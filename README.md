# Unit 2 - Store Management Project

## Introduction

You are opening a new business in your community! Businesses often need programs to manage the products and services they offer and track orders and requests from customers. Your goal is to create a store management system for your business.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming and class structure and design to create your store management system:
- **Create a class hierarchy** – Develop a superclass that represents a product or service your business offers and one or more subclasses that extend the superclass to represent more specific types of products or services.
- **Declare instance variables** – Declare instance variables in the superclass that are shared with the subclasses and instance variables in the subclasses that are not shared with the superclass.
- **Write constructors** – Write no-argument and parameterized constructors in the superclass and subclasses. Subclass constructors use the super keyword to call the superclass constructor.
- **Implement accessor and mutator methods** – Write accessor and mutator methods for instance variables that should be accessible and/or modifiable from outside of the class.
- **Implement a toString() method** – Write toString() methods in the superclass and subclasses that return information about the state of an object.

## Description


In this project I made a store that sells different types of photos. My store sells colored and black and white photos for different prices. I choose this idea because I like pictures and photography, I find it calming and personal when I make something relating to my interests and ideals. This projetct came to fruition because I used a few variables to describe the photos and both their general and unique characteristics. This includes price, the date the photo was taken, the photographer resposible for the photo, the color mode, and even the name of the camera that was used to take the photo! I used system out print line to display all the different characteristics of the two differing photos. They Read: Photo: The Night Sky, Photographer: Gerald Rhemann, Date Taken: 9.15.2022, Camera: Canon EOS R6 Mark II, Price: $200.0, Color Mode: Full Color
Photo: Famous Artist, Photographer: Rembrandt, Date Taken: 2.27.2021, Camera: Fujifilm X-T5, Price: $150.0, Color Mode: Black and White. 

Thank You!
